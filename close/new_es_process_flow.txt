Instruction:
    1. Gmail no longer allow to sent email vai smtp with the regular password. You need to enable two-factor authentication,
        IMAP & create app password for every connected account use Gmail. I tested this & it works on this way.
        Google the procedure if you do not have idea.


Process:
 1. script will create 2 tables in DB. (connected_accounts & emails)

 2. All the connected accounts should be entered manually.
    value should not be null for `account_password` when `send_via_close` is false. this is the pass for gmail

 3. For every successful email sent, emails table will get an entry.
    If this table already had an entry for a contact then this contact will be ignored at next run.

 4. Each account must wait 16 minutes to send next email

 5. Maximum limit per day for an account is 30

 6. There is a waiting limit of 16 minutes when all the connected accounts attempts to send emails.
    This will prevent ignoring connected accounts at the next iteration.
